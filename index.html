A Hand to the Needy, A Heart to Serve
</p>

<p>
As we step out, with hearts so bright,<br>
To bring hope to those in endless night.<br>
Our outreach mission, a labor of love,<br>
To serve the needy, sent from above.
</p>

<p>
With every step, with every deed,<br>
We show the world, a different creed.<br>
One of kindness, compassion, and care,<br>
A reflection of God's love we share.
</p>

<p>
The Sharing Cohorts, united as one,<br>
With a purpose clear, to help has just begun.<br>
We'll bring food, clothes, and a listening ear,<br>
To those who struggle, and those who fear.
</p>

<p>
Our service is not just a task or chore,<br>
But an act of worship, to honor more.<br>
The God who gives, who loves, and who cares,<br>
We'll reflect His heart, through our willing shares.
</p>

<p>
So let's go forth, with joy and cheer,<br>
To make a difference, to wipe away a tear.<br>
For in serving others, we serve the King,<br>
And our hearts beat stronger, with love that clings.
